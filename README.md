# PlaceOS Template User Interfaces

![BUILD](https://github.com/placeos/user-interfaces/workflows/BUILD/badge.svg)
![TEST](https://github.com/placeos/user-interfaces/workflows/TEST/badge.svg)

## Setup

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
1. Run `npm install` in the root folder
1. Run `npm install --global nx` to install [NX](https://github.com/nrwl/nx)
1. Run `npm install --global @angular/cli` to install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Development

To run the dev server use the command `nx serve <project>` e.g. `nx serve control`

By default the dev web server proxies all requests to the set live system, if you wish to use a mock requests and systems press `Ctrl + Alt/Option + Shift + M` to reload the page in mock mode. To leave mock mode you can repeat the keypresses.

## Compilation

Compile the application into static files using `nx build <project>` e.g. `nx build bookings`

The command takes the arguments `--prod` to minify the resulting build and `--aot` to compile the angular code using the angular Ahead of Time compiler.

Default application/runtime settings can be found in `projects/<project>/app/settings.ts`

## Tests

Unit tests can be run using `nx test <project>` e.g. `nx test kiosk`

Integration tests can be run first starting up the webpack dev server with `nx serve`, setting `mock` to `true` in `projects/<project>/app/settings.ts` and running cypress with `nx e2e <project>-e2e`

## Deployment

Github actions have been setup for creating build artifacts and deploying them to a standalone branch on this repository.

Each application has a seperate branch dedicated to each of it's build types.

Commits to the branch `develop` will produce development builds that are committed to the branches `build/<project>/dev`  
Commits to the branch `release/**` will produce development builds that are committed to the branches `build/<project>/uat`.
You should have only one `release` branch at a time and it should be kept inline with develop rather than worked on directly.  
Commits to the branch `master` will produce a production build that is commited to the branch `build/<project>/prod`
